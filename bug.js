This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device-specific information, such as the device's unique ID.  The issue is that the value returned by Constants.deviceId is not always consistent.  Sometimes it returns a valid unique ID, while at other times it returns null or undefined, resulting in unexpected behavior in the application. This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on this value for tasks such as user identification or analytics tracking. The problem appears to be intermittent and doesn't seem to be tied to a specific device or Expo SDK version, making it harder to debug and reproduce consistently.
