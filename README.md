# Inconsistent Results from Expo Constants.deviceId

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Expo Constants API's `deviceId` property.  The `deviceId` value exhibits inconsistent behavior, sometimes returning a valid unique identifier and other times returning `null` or `undefined`. This inconsistency makes it challenging to depend on `deviceId` for tasks such as user identification or analytics tracking.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the unreliable nature of the `Constants.deviceId` result. The value returned varies unpredictably, hindering the development of applications that depend on a consistent unique identifier for each device.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal example that demonstrates the inconsistent behavior. Run the example multiple times to observe the fluctuating return values of `Constants.deviceId`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential workaround for this issue. It implements a mechanism to store and manage device identifiers more reliably, by using AsyncStorage to persistently store the deviceId and only accessing Constants.deviceId once.
